		" JavaScript",
		" jQuery",
		" API's",

	"usage": "To run the program, while the terminal is opened within the application folder, type \"node index\" to initialize the line of questioning.  Then, just follow the prompts until the program is complete.  Some questions will require an answer to move forward, and other questions left blank, will still generate that section in the README.md.",
	"licenseDetails": "The program is not currently licensed.",
	"contributionDetails": "Contributions are not currently being accepted due to the finalization of the project. However, if you are interested in integrating future development, email me at ryan.skog@outlook.com.",
