  ## Description

  The readme-writer is a CLI application run via Node.js to generate a basic, but usable README.md file for the developer to use in their projects.

  ## Installation

  To run the application, you will need install any dependencies first by typing "npm i" in the terminal within the application folder.  After all dependencies have been installed, the application can be initialized by typing "node index".

  ## Usage

  To run the program, while the terminal is opened within the application folder, type "node index" to initialize the line of questioning.  Then, just follow the prompts until the program is complete.  Some questions will require an answer to move forward, and other questions left blank, will still generate that section in the README.md.

  ## Tools

  The following tools were used in the development of this project:
   JavaScript, jQuery, API's, JSON, Node.js

  ## License

  The program is not currently licensed.

  ## Roadmap

  Currently, there are no plans for additions to this application.  However, future development could integrate a more dynamic line of questioning to better gear the README file to the developer's needs.

  ## Contributions
